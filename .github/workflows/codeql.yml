# CodeQL Advanced Setup for Java 25
#
# The default CodeQL setup (autobuild) does not support Java 25 and will fail.
# This workflow uses manual build mode with explicit Java 25 and Gradle configuration.
#
# IMPORTANT: The default CodeQL setup must be disabled in repository settings,
# otherwise it will continue to run and fail alongside this workflow.
# To switch: Settings → Code security → Code scanning → CodeQL analysis → Switch to advanced
